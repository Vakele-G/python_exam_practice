    """
    Financial Analysis / Software Subscription Models context.

    Determine the usage unit 'u' where the total cost of Plan A equals
    the total cost of Plan B. Both costs follow a linear model: C(u) = F + M * u.

    Use matplotlib and numpy to help you visualize the two cost functions and their intersection point.
    Use your solutions to plot the points on your graphs and save a screenshot in your project folder.

    Args:
        cost_A_params (list[float]): (F_A, M_A) - Fixed cost and marginal cost for Plan A.
        cost_B_params (list[float]): (F_B, M_B) - Fixed cost and marginal cost for Plan B.

    The breakeven point is found by solving F_A + M_A * u = F_B + M_B * u for u.

    Returns:
        float: The usage unit u at the breakeven point.
               Returns -1.0 if the marginal costs are equal (parallel lines).

    Given a flow rate R(t) modeled by a quadratic function R(t) = a*t^2 + b*t + c,
    compute the total net accumulated amount over a time interval [time_start, time_end].

    This requires computing the definite integral of R(t) from time_start to time_end.

    Use matplotlib and numpy to help you visualize the flow rate function and the area under the curve.
    Use your solutions to plot the points on your graphs and save a screenshot in your project folder.

    Args:
